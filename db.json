    "title": "Pep Guardiola: Impossible for Manchester City to sign expensive Sergio Aguero replacement",

    "body": "Pep Guardiola says it is likely Manchester City will not sign a striker to replace Sergio Aguero this summer, with the prices being quoted for top talent making it \"impossible\".\n\nCity announced on Monday that Aguero, their all-time leading scorer, would be leaving the club at the end of the season when his contract expires and, although they have been searching, Guardiola says the Argentine will be \"irreplaceable\".\n\nSky Sports News has reported that, although they have been following Borussia Dortmund's Erling Haaland - the most coveted striker in Europe - his valuation of more than £100m may price City out of a deal, leading them to consider Danny Ings as a more attainable option.\n\nAnd, ahead of Saturday's trip to Leicester live on Sky Sports Premier League, Guardiola told a news conference: \"There is a big chance we are not going to sign a striker this summer.\n\n\"We have enough players in the first-team right now and we have interesting players in the academy, so there is a big chance that, because of the economic situation in the world right now, we are not going to sign a striker next season.\n\n\"With these prices, we are not going to buy any striker. It's impossible, we can't afford it. That is not going to happen. All the clubs struggle financially, and we are not an exception.\n\n\"We have Gabriel Jesus, we have Ferran Torres, who played incredibly this season in that position, we have young players in the academy, and we play many times with a false nine.\n\n\"I don't know what's going to happen, maybe it is going to happen, but maybe we are not going to buy any striker for the next season. Today there is more chance we are not going to buy any striker for the next season.\"\n\nGuardiola was speaking just 24 hours after Haaland's agent Mino Raiola and father Alfe Inge met with representatives of Barcelona and Real Madrid in Spain, with Borussia Dortmund ready to battle to keep him also from the likes of Chelsea and Manchester United.\n\nIngs' contract situation at St Mary's puts City in a stronger position for a more realistic fee; he is about to enter the final year of his deal and has so far not agreed to sign new terms that have been on offer for some time - but his injury problems this season are a concern after they blighted his time at Liverpool.\n\nDespite their considerable financial backing, City are wary of Financial Fair Play rules and their transfer record remains the £65m they paid to sign Riyad Mahez from Leicester. They have also shown they will not panic buy a replacement even for a top player, waiting a year to replace Vincent Kompany with Ruben Dias."

      "title": "Suez Canal Crisis: Ship blocking canal may be due to human error",
      "author": "Aaron Reich",
      "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106860121-1616780983446-106860121-1616772119794-02_close_up_view_of_ever_given_ship_suez_canal_26march2021_wv2.jpg?v=1616781003&w=1600&h=900",
      "body": "The massive cargo ship that had blocked Egypt's Suez Canal bringing global trade to a near-standstill for almost a week may have been the result of human or technical failure, the head of the Suez Canal Authority said over the weekend.\n\nThe ship finally moved early Sunday morning after a week-long operation to get it to budge from where it had come aground. \nEarly reports had indicated that high winds and a sandstorm blocking visibility had caused the giant 200,000 ton Ever Given to be stuck in one of the world's most vital shipping canals. However, this seems to not have been the case.\nCanal Authority chairman Osama Rabie told reporters on Saturday that “There may have been technical or human errors,” not providing more details other than the fact that “All of these factors will become apparent in the investigation,” the BBC reported.\nThe fact that human error may have been the cause for the disaster might contradict earlier reports, but many individuals within the shipping industry are unsurprised. As noted in 2017 by Maritime Journal, human error accounts for anywhere between 75% and 96% of maritime accidents. \nAccording to British journalist and author Rose George, many crews are smaller and on larger ships, causing them to be exhausted with busy schedules less time to relax. As a result, ships are working with over-exhausted crews.\nAnother factor to consider is that the Ever Given's crew wasn't actually in control of the ship at the time, but rather the Suez pilots were.\nThe Suez Canal, like other canals, requires many ships to have a small \"Suez crew\" that board the ship, with their own pilot taking the helm. As George noted in an op-ed in the UK daily The Guardian, this is standard practice in modern shipping, with vessels taking local pilots in difficult areas as they have local knowledge.\nNotably, however, it is the ship's original master that holds all responsibility if something goes wrong. As noted by Suez Canal Authority documents posted online by the company Seaways Marine and reported on by the Canadian newspaper National Post, “Masters are held solely responsible for all damage or accidents of whatever kind resulting from the navigation or handling of their vessels directly or indirectly by day or night.” This is because the canal pilots “cannot know the defects or difficulties of maneuverability for every vessel.” \nIndeed, the Ever Given had two such canal pilots on board.\nWhile these pilots are well trained – and this training has been described by the Finnish marine company Wartsila, which provides the Suez Canal Authority with training simulators for their pilots – not everyone has had the most positive experience with these pilots. Notably, George recounted one such experience with a Suez pilot, writing in The Guardian that \"the pilot we had was too busy eating his way through the entire menu, and dozing, to be particularly commanding.\"\nHowever, the identity of the pilots on board the Ever Given remain unknown, and the company behind the ship, Japanese firm Shoei Kisen Kaisha, has apologized for the blockage.\nThe massive cargo ship is one of the largest in the world, and contains some 18,300 containers of various cargo. Her blockage of the Suez Canal when she ran aground last Tuesday has caused severe damage to global trade, with some estimating the damage to be as much as $400 million an hour, with at least 369 ships waiting to cross the canal.\nVarious efforts have been made to move her, with tugboats working to shift her and dredgers shifting sand to make the water less shallow. However, the ship remains stuck in place, barring a slight movement over the weekend. A possible cause for this may be a mass of rock at the bow of the ship, but it remains unclear how difficult this would be to overcome.\nThe slight movement was considered a cause for celebration, however, and many tugboats were shown honking horns in celebration in a video released over social media.\nReuters contributed to this report.",

      "body": "Spanish newspaper Marca believes that Paris Saint-Germain will tie down Neymar for another four years at the club, but that Kylian Mbappe’s future is far from certain. The French 22-year-old striker is out of contract in 2022 and may not be willing to extend his stay any longer. Should that happen then PSG will sell him this summer to avoid losing him for nothing.\n\nPaper Round’s view: Mbappe is on his way to becoming one of the best players in the world and as Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi begin to finally fade out from view, it will be between him and Erling Haaland to be the most prominent players in the world. If he does decide to leave PSG then almost every big club will attempt to sign him regardless of their financial situation.",

      "body": "Over the past few months, bitcoin prices have been trading incredibly well. However, the cryptocurrency has been under pressure lately.\n\nThe recent dip sent bitcoin down toward $50,000 and a key moving average.\n\nBitcoin rallied on March 24 on news that Tesla  (TSLA) - Get Report would begin accepting the cryptocurrency as payment. However, it was hammered from the highs as the 10-day and 21-day moving averages rejected it.\n\nThe move comes at a time where there has been great debate over bitcoin’s role and its future direction. One report called it dirty, slow and impractical. Another said bitcoin could hit $100,000.\n\nOn the flip side, cryptocurrencies have driven strong growth for companies like PayPal  (PYPL) - Get Report and Square  (SQ) - Get Report, while others like Coinbase are aiming to go public now.\n\nAt any rate, where can bitcoin go from here?\n\nOn Thursday before the market opened, those watching bitcoin noticed it tagged the key 50-day moving average.\n\nBitcoin held firm on Thursday, giving investors a modest bounce, but weren’t able to turn higher on the day. That’s OK, as long as support held, which it did.\n\nNow we’re getting a rotation up through Thursday’s high as bitcoin pushes through $53,116.\n\nThe action is solid, but we need to see more follow-through. Specifically, bulls are looking forbitcoin to push back up through its 10-day and 21-day moving averages - the two measures that were resistance a few days ago on that Tesla rally.\n\nIf it can do that, $58,000 is on deck, followed by $60,000 and the all-time highs. If bitcoin goes on to make new highs on this move, a rally to the $67,600 area is possible.\n\nThat level marks the 161.8% extension from the February pullback.\n\nIf bitcoin can’t garner much momentum from here - for instance, say it fails to reclaim its short-term moving averages - then we need to consider the downside, too.\n\nShould the cryptocurrency lose the 50-day moving average as support, look for the 10-week moving average to attract buyers near $48,500.\n\nA close below this mark could put $45,000 and the 100-day moving average in play. For now, investors can stay bullish while the 50-day moving average remains support. ",

      "body": "(CNN) With some wind in his sails from the massively popular Covid relief package, President Joe Biden's next big legislative push -- a sweeping infrastructure plan -- is set to bring a far more challenging bipartisan test in the coming weeks.\n\nThe \"Build Back Better\" infrastructure proposal that White House aides are putting together would be segmented into two separate parts -- one focused on infrastructure and clean energy, and a second focused on what's being termed the \"care economy\" with a focus zeroed in on key domestic economic issues.\nIn full, it would mark a sweeping move toward enacting the key elements of the \"jobs\" agenda that Biden laid out in large part during his campaign for president, with a suite of potential tax increases on corporations and the wealthy as options to finance any longer-term spending in the final proposal.\nThat's where things get tricky.\nAs CNN's John Harwood writes, the plan contains some fat political targets. Republicans deride as \"welfare\" some of the tax credits it directs to help families climb the economic ladder.\nThey skewer alternative energy investments and regulations to combat climate change as costly and radical.\nAs Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell summarized it: \"A so-called infrastructure proposal that may actually be a Trojan horse for massive tax hikes and other job-killing left-wing policies.\"\nBut Biden is determined to find Republican support. The President plans to pursue bipartisan support, according to his advisers. He's already held multiple bipartisan Oval Office meetings on the issue. During a meeting with labor leaders in February, Biden repeatedly stressed that he thought there was a path for bipartisanship on the issue, according to an attendee.\nThere's still a backup plan. Officials are also planning for congressional Democrats to move concurrently with a budget procedure that would allow any package to pass with a simple majority in the US Senate.\nThe nuts and bolts. The infrastructure proposal would focus heavily on money for roads, bridges and rails, and would include hundreds of billions in spending for climate-related measures, as well as climate-related research and development. It also would include $100 billion for education infrastructure.\nThe domestic economy piece of the plan would include key Biden campaign priorities such as universal pre-K, significant spending on childcare, care-giving and proposals designed to try and address portions of the workforce hit hardest by the pandemic economy.\nThe debate will kick off in earnest soon. While the planning remains fluid, officials are tentatively eyeing Biden's joint address to Congress -- likely to be scheduled in April -- as a moment where the key thematic elements of the package are made clear.",

      "body": "Tesla Model Y demand in China hasn’t changed much, even though the automaker raised the all-electric crossover price last week. New reports from Chinese media indicate that foot traffic in Tesla showrooms remains stable, despite the increased prices. The outlet also interviewed 20 potential buyers, who gave their insights regarding the potential purchase of the all-electric Model Y in the future.\n\nLast week, Tesla increased the price of the two offered variants of the Model Y in China. The Dual Motor Long Range All-Wheel Drive increased from ¥339,900 to ¥347,900, while the Performance variant rose from ¥369,900 to ¥377,900. The ¥8,000 ($1,217) price increase was attributed to the Model Y’s increased demand in China, cracking into the top 3 in sales for the first time in February, just two months into its sales campaign in the country.\n\nDespite the price increase in China, however, it does not scare potential buyers from coming in to check out the vehicle. News reports from Caijing, a Chinese media outlet, indicate that Tesla showrooms are experiencing normal amounts of foot traffic, even though the Model Y was bumped up in price by ¥8,000 last week. Several Shanghai-located Tesla showrooms were visited by reporters from Caijing, who indicated that there was no change in the number of people visiting showrooms. The visits were made over a period of two days: once on March 24th and another on March 27th.\n\nAdditionally, 20 potential buyers who were interested in the Model Y were interviewed by the Chinese outlet. 13 of them indicated they were willing to pay the additional ¥8,000 for the vehicle. Simultaneously, the other 7 said that they would consider buying the car and may place orders after the “price stabilized.”\n\n\nThe report paints a clear picture of Tesla’s demand in China, a sustained and well-developed number that continues to improve over time. The Model Y, despite only being available in the market since January, broke into the top 3 in sales figures for February, only trailing the Wuling HongGuang Mini EV, the first-place car for the past six months in China, and the Model 3, the most popular electric car in China in 2020. The Model Y is likely set to be a large-scale contributor to Tesla’s ultimate growth in China, which Elon Musk has said will be the automaker’s largest market in the long-term.\n\n“China in the long term will be our biggest market, both where we make the most number of vehicles and where we have the most number of customers,” Musk said. “I’d like to strike an optimistic note, and I’m very confident that the future of China is going to be great and that China is headed towards being the biggest economy in the world and a lot of prosperity in the future.”\n\nTesla’s growth in China also aligns with the government’s goal of being carbon neutral by 2060, a task that can only be reached by adopting sustainable forms of energy and transportation. “These are very aggressive goals, and I think they are great goals, and I wish other countries had these goals,” Musk said.",

It's almost inherent, sadly, in the historic fabric of this country,\" Soon-Shiong, the founder and executive chairman of biotech company ImmunityBio, told CNN Business in his first public comments about the surge of anti-Asian hostilities. \"We have to recognize that, accept it and then break it.\"\nSoon-Shiong, who is of Chinese descent and was born in South Africa, expressed dismay at the recent spike in hate crimes against Asian Americans as well as the racial tensions that fueled the Black Lives Matter movement.\nThis country better wake up to this because it becomes something that this next generation will deal with.\"\n\nPATRICK SOON-SHIONG, EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN OF IMMUNITYBIO\n\n\"I came from South Africa, where I saw [racism] growing up. The difference, in a funny way, is that it was Apartheid, but it was Apartheid in the open,\" said Soon-Shiong, who moved to the United States in 1977. \"I thought we were coming to the land of the free. And frankly, I've been completely disenchanted.\"\nThe comments make Soon-Shiong one of the highest-profile Asian business leaders to speak out about the recent attacks on Asian Americans. And he urged more Asian Americans to do the same.\n\"Unfortunately, the Asian culture and mentality is to just suck it up. Do your work. Do your thing. Be quiet,\" Soon-Shiong said. \"I don't think that can happen any longer.\"\n'Lack of empathy'\nSoon-Shiong, who graduated from medical school at the age of 23 and whose wealth Forbes pegs at $7.5 billion, made his fortune in part by inventing the blockbuster cancer drug Abraxane. He later bought a stake in the Los Angeles Lakers from Magic Johnson, and then acquired the LA Times and San Diego Union-Tribune for $500 million in 2018.\nLong before he became one of the wealthiest doctors on the planet and the \"Barnum of biotech,\" as Forbes puts it, Soon-Shiong said he experienced discrimination while working as a surgical resident at UCLA in the 1980s.\nNo one was listening.\nAsian business owners react to Atlanta shootings\n'No one was listening.' Asian business owners react to Atlanta shootings\n\"One professor from UCLA that had a house next door quite openly said, 'We don't like people like you here.' It was pretty blatant,\" he said.\nEarlier this week, a 65-year-old Asian woman was attacked in broad daylight in Midtown Manhattan in what police are calling a hate crime: \"F**k you, you don't belong here, you Asian,\" the assailant said prior to the attack, according to the criminal complaint.\n\"The lack of empathy for the human being, whether she's Asian, green, black, blue — that's a human being, a 65-year-old-lady in severe distress,\" Soon-Shiong said, adding that he found it \"heartbreaking\" that bystanders did not intervene.\n\"This country better wake up to this, because it becomes something that this next generation will deal with,\" he said.\nPatrick Soon-Shiong, the doctor-turned-entrepreneur, made his fortune in part by inventing blockbuster cancer drug Abraxane. He later bought a stake in the Los Angeles Lakers and acquired the LA Times. \nPatrick Soon-Shiong, the doctor-turned-entrepreneur, made his fortune in part by inventing blockbuster cancer drug Abraxane. He later bought a stake in the Los Angeles Lakers and acquired the LA Times.\nThe Trump factor\nThe heightened racial tensions come in the midst of a once-in-a-century pandemic that originated in China.\nSoon-Shiong said former President Donald Trump \"absolutely\" shares some responsibility for the anti-Asian attacks because he called Covid-19 the \"Kung Flu\" and the China virus.\n\"That really didn't help at all,\" Soon-Shiong said. \"It didn't help the Asians, didn't help the Black community, the Latino community. The racism was just flamed.\"\nSoon-Shiong, whose company ImmunityBio is working on a vaccine candidate, said the Biden administration has done a \"fantastic\" job in rolling out Covid vaccines and successfully encouraging Americans to get shots.\nYet he cautioned that no one knows how long the protection afforded by the vaccines will last and said he's \"really concerned\" about coronavirus variants that have yet to fully reach US shores.\nNext-generation vaccines\nLast month, Soon-Shiong completed the merger of two of his biotech companies: NantKWest and ImmunityBio. The newly combined company, now known simply as ImmunityBio, is testing a next-generation vaccine that aims to overcome variants by not just blocking the virus, but killing it completely using T-cells.\nSoon-Shiong urged governments to fund the next generation of vaccine research and \"face the fact that this pandemic may be ongoing if we don't address it now.\"\nThere are to reparations, says the first Black Fed president\nThere are 'definitely merits' to reparations, says the first Black Fed president\nCritically, ImmunityBio's vaccine candidate is an oral capsule that can be stored at room temperature. Phase 1 trials are ongoing in both the United States and South Africa.\n\"You can mail [the pills] across all of Africa. Now you can vaccinate a billion people,\" Soon-Shiong said, adding that the treatment could also potentially serve as a universal booster.\nSoon-Shiong said his work to help South Africa, and Africa broadly, defeat the pandemic fulfills a promise he made decades ago to eventually return to his home country.\n\"It's taken me a long time,\" he said, \"but I'm coming back.\"",

      "body": "Pep Guardiola says it is likely Manchester City will not sign a striker to replace Sergio Aguero this summer, with the prices being quoted for top talent making it \"impossible\".\n\nCity announced on Monday that Aguero, their all-time leading scorer, would be leaving the club at the end of the season when his contract expires and, although they have been searching, Guardiola says the Argentine will be \"irreplaceable\".\n\nSky Sports News has reported that, although they have been following Borussia Dortmund's Erling Haaland - the most coveted striker in Europe - his valuation of more than £100m may price City out of a deal, leading them to consider Danny Ings as a more attainable option.\n\nAnd, ahead of Saturday's trip to Leicester live on Sky Sports Premier League, Guardiola told a news conference: \"There is a big chance we are not going to sign a striker this summer.\n\n\"We have enough players in the first-team right now and we have interesting players in the academy, so there is a big chance that, because of the economic situation in the world right now, we are not going to sign a striker next season.\n\n\"With these prices, we are not going to buy any striker. It's impossible, we can't afford it. That is not going to happen. All the clubs struggle financially, and we are not an exception.\n\n\"We have Gabriel Jesus, we have Ferran Torres, who played incredibly this season in that position, we have young players in the academy, and we play many times with a false nine.\n\n\"I don't know what's going to happen, maybe it is going to happen, but maybe we are not going to buy any striker for the next season. Today there is more chance we are not going to buy any striker for the next season.\"\n\nGuardiola was speaking just 24 hours after Haaland's agent Mino Raiola and father Alfe Inge met with representatives of Barcelona and Real Madrid in Spain, with Borussia Dortmund ready to battle to keep him also from the likes of Chelsea and Manchester United.\n\nIngs' contract situation at St Mary's puts City in a stronger position for a more realistic fee; he is about to enter the final year of his deal and has so far not agreed to sign new terms that have been on offer for some time - but his injury problems this season are a concern after they blighted his time at Liverpool.\n\nDespite their considerable financial backing, City are wary of Financial Fair Play rules and their transfer record remains the £65m they paid to sign Riyad Mahez from Leicester. They have also shown they will not panic buy a replacement even for a top player, waiting a year to replace Vincent Kompany with Ruben Dias.",
